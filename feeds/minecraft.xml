&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have a Minecraft account because I bought the game in 2011 and lost my account, yet I refuse to buy the game again for twice its original price. Screw you Microsoft I‚Äôm not paying for Bedrock edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using TLauncher - the ORIGINAL TLauncher - for many years now, but as I switched from PC to PC I ended up with the infamous clone that was accused of being full of spyware not too long ago. I haven‚Äôt played Minecraft in a good while so I didn‚Äôt bother switching clients until a few days ago when I wanted to play for a bit and kept hearing that TLauncher isn‚Äôt safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blindly looking for a cracked Minecraft client that isn‚Äôt full of malware is a difficult task, so I asked for recomendations and tried them all, then I got into the MultiMC forks rabbithole and tried some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular I was looking for a client to play 1.20.2 with Forge and a few specific mods, and for it to have some sort of skin support. These are the ones I tried, split into the ones I deleted and the ones I kept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clients-i-deleted&quot;&gt;Clients I deleted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multimc&quot;&gt;MultiMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one I got recommended but it isn‚Äôt cracked so it‚Äôs useless for me. Nearly every client in this list is a fork of this one lmao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://multimc.org/&quot;&gt;MultiMC website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salwyrr&quot;&gt;Salwyrr&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the website they don‚Äôt have the version I want (it said 1.8.9 - 1.19.2) but I decided to try nonetheless. I downloaded the .jar version and it told me to download the other version. uh. ok i guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed the .exe one and for some reason it opened up in windowed full screen in my second monitor. Weird. It also didn‚Äôt load so I only had a dark gray window. Re-installed it and it finally worked. I rejected their cookies and opened up the settings but the only two settings are ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù and to modify my cookie preferences. I assume the RAM thing is maximum RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website was indeed correct and they only had up to version 1.19.2, but I still wanted to try it out so I launched version 1.12.2. It froze for a good while but it did work at the end. The menu and settings is completely revamped to match their dark gray minimalistic theme with iOS emojis, and they had a bunch of Hypixel specific mods and settings that I didn‚Äôt touch. I tried creating a world aaaaand it‚Äôs premium only. Apparently they removed offline accounts in March of this year for legal and partnership reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the trash bin it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salwyrr.com/&quot;&gt;Salwyrr website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prismlauncher&quot;&gt;PrismLauncher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MultiMC fork. It‚Äôs not cracked :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently you can allow offline accounts by modifying the code and compiling it yourself but it‚Äôs a bother and wouldn‚Äôt let me use skins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://prismlauncher.org/&quot;&gt;PrismLauncher website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clients-i-kept&quot;&gt;Clients I kept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ultimmc&quot;&gt;UltimMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another MultiMC fork, this one cracked, that allows local and Ely.by accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was perfect with this one but then I tried adding Forge to my 1.20.2 instance and it just wouldn‚Äôt launch. I tried switching to every Java version I have (which are A LOT ngl) and still didn‚Äôt work. Disabling Forge made it able to launch again and I also tried making a 1.12.2 Forge instance and it did work. So I have no clue of what‚Äôs wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it didn‚Äôt work at the end it seems like a puntual error (?) so I‚Äôm keeping it. I opened an issue on its repo so hopefully they‚Äôll fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UltimMC/Launcher&quot;&gt;UltimMC github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pollymc&quot;&gt;PollyMC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fork of PrismLauncher (and by extension a MultiMC fork) that allows offline accounts and alternative auth servers, like Ely.by or LittleSkin. Getting the alt auth servers to work is a bit trickier than in UltimMC since you need to input the URL of the page you‚Äôre using but it‚Äôs easy enough and explained in the documentation. It also lets you choose a mod loader as you create the instance instead of adding it later, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unlike UltimMC, this one did manage to launch my beloved 1.20.2 Forge instance. üíû&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC&quot;&gt;PollyMC github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sklauncher&quot;&gt;SKlauncher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is SO SLOW??? Huh????????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waiting FOREVER to make an account and FOREVER to load my profile to edit it and EVEN MORE FOREVERS for the downloads page to work I finally got it and installed it. Loading also took forever, but that didn‚Äôt bother me as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it refuses to launch, though. Idk why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website has a whole section where you choose your skin and everything, but for some reason the client only lets you login with Microsoft or use an offline account. I thought ‚ÄúWhat? So there‚Äôs no way of having skins? What was that section of the website for then?‚Äù but it turns out that the offline account takes the skin from the SKlauncher account from the website. Without asking for a password. Strange, but the only ‚Äústealable‚Äù thing there is your skin so it doesn‚Äôt matter much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client itself has a modern minimalistic look and you can create instances with Forge, Fabric, Quill and everything. It also has a section for downloading modpacks and it seems that individual mod downloading is planned for version 3.3 of the launcher (I‚Äôm using 3.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the 1.20.2 instance and launched it, it uses the same folder as TLauncher so I was greeted by the mods I already had, which was a nice surprise since that meant that I didn‚Äôt have to move anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it‚Äôs good and it did what I wanted. I wish the program didn‚Äôt give up on loading sometimes, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://skmedix.pl/&quot;&gt;SKlauncher website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is that my cheap forgetful ass wouldn‚Äôt have so many problems if it stoped being cheap or forgetful. Since I would have a legal Minecraft account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I‚Äôm using PollyMC on virtue of it loading faster than SKlauncher, and I‚Äôm making sure that my old TLauncher stuff is in SKlauncher so that I can delete it for good. I‚Äôll probably end up keeping the one with the best skin support or one of the Github ones since they‚Äôre FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>NynaSunner</name></author><category term="minecraft" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Intro</summary></entry></feed>
