I finally made this thing work got damn!!!!

Ok this is [Kalechips' listfauxgraphy](https://github.com/kayleconut/listfauxgraphy) but modified so it uses Jekyll to generate the little note things, written in markdown, instead of having to edit a shittload of html every time

Oh and I removed the dragula stuff. Sorry but I didn't like it ðŸ˜”

Man I'm making this on a win 11 pc and the emojis suck ass, wadda hell

So yeah I just want to take up more space to see and lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
