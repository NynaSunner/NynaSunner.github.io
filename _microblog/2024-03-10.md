Got my PC back :D

It was awful, at the end I had to open it and replace the hard drive myself. But it's finally done :3

I'm very tired after having to reinstall everything so I couldn't work much on the PHP thing, but I did finish making the new site button! At first I just wanted to remake the WIP I was working on before the PC died but I kept going and finished it lol

I'm not too sure about the border and for the background I originally wanted to use a purple and blue gradient but I couldn't get it to look right, plus using a gradient increased the file size by 50%, so dark purple it is.

Oh, and completely unrelated but yesterday I went to watch Dune 2 and no spoilers but there's a part where they show a planet that orbits a black sun, so under its light everything is in black and white. In the movie it looks so cool and from a worldbuilding perspective it fascinates me a lot, specially because indoors everything has color so it's just the sunlight that makes everything B&W. I'm stealing that shit so hard
