I'm a dumbass, I just discovered that typing `markdown="1"` markdownifies the content inside HTML tags, I've been typing list tags inside `<details>` instead of simply using markdown all this time like a dumbass ðŸ˜­

Ok, that aside I messed a bit with the way post tags generate because they were appearing at a weird url but it doesn't change anything. I wanted to be able to have tags sepparated with spaces but the list of tags ordered by quantity didn't like that. Sooo nothing changed really

I started working yesterday on a log of videogames I've played, and while doing so I thought that I could probably revamp the interests section in my about page to make it look nicer. This probably means that I'll get distracted and never do either of those things xd.

Yesterday they released [Sky: COTL](https://www.thatskygame.com/) for Steam which means that I can now play without my phone exploding. Let's hope I don't become super obsessed with it now that my productivity is back. Also went to my first Aurora concert! It was so pretty :3
