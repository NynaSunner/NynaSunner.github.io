I've been playing a bit of Pixelmon and a lot of Cobblemon this past week, though the seed of the Cobblemon server is super cursed so there's nothing but ice and powder snow. God, how I hate powder snow. The snow is snowier than before.

Though some pokémon don't look good in the cubic style I really like how Cobblemon looks. It's definitely very new since some pokémon like eiscue drop four items on death and some drop nothing, the dex is very incomplete, berries barely have any use, etc. But it's still very promising. A friend added a breeding mod and we managed to get mons with better natures and hidden abilities, though we've had no luck with shinies yet.

We added Terralith in the Cobblemon server since we had Biomes O' Plenty in the Pixelmon one but it turned out to be a massive mistake since finding different biomes now is super hard, resulting in not seeing many different pokémon and making traveling a pain in the ass since Cobblemon doesn't have riding like Pixelmon does, resulting in us having to trudge through the fucking powder snow.

Did I already mention that I hate powder snow?
