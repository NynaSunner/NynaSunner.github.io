THE FIRE EMBLEM THRACIA 776 TAKANAGI MANGA IS BEING TRANSLATED HOLY SHIT!!! I read the prologue chapter ages ago and it was really promising! The kids are sooo cute aaaAAAAAAAA!!!! [Link here <3](https://mangadex.org/chapter/99df4a3c-5b2f-467e-872c-3fd7c6925431)

Crying and sobbing and shitting aside, I almost forgot to mention that I have a temporary button now. I made it two days ago on photoshop in like 5 minutes, because I just wanted a simple placeholder until I make or commision a decent one

At the end I ended up changing it a bunch of times. The background and font were ugly as hell so I got new ones, added a text shadow, modified the text some more because I didn't like how tall the capital letters were, and added a second frame to show the URL. It's still ugly as hell, though
