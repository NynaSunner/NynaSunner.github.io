Finally added light mode to the site, though it's ugly as hell and I don't like it. It's my first time making a light theme (because I hate them), so hopefully I'll get better at it over time and make it decent

On another note, it's only midday and I'm already ranting with strangers online about how Quan isn't a bad father and *for the love of god* stop saying he wanted to bring his 4 year old daughter to war when NO HE FUCKING DIDN'T! I'm considering making a post about this here so I don't have to repeat myself over multiple platforms
