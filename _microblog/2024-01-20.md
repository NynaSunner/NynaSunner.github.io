Not much has happened but it's been a while since I last wrote here so I wanted to lol

I've been collecting all the fanstranslated FE4 and FE5 stuff (as in mangas and novels) I could find, because some of these can only be found through twitter posts from a while ago and trying to find anything on twitter is absolutely fucking terrible. I'll probably make a post about it soon and add more links as more stuff is translated or uncovered.

My tamagotchi died today at 22 (kinda fucked up of him to die at the age I currently have but ok) and taking care of it these days made me think of how simple this virtual pet is. So I want to try and make a tamagotchi from scratch on pure JS, using cookies to save progress between sessions. No clue when I'll actually move my lazy ass to do it tho lmao

And to add yet another completely unrelated topic to the list, yesterday morning I saw this fanart of Nanna and Leif and I've been giggling and kicking and squealing like a teenager every time I think about it

God, I love them so much
