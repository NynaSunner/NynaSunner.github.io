Happy (belated) new year!

Honestly, the end of the year made me realize how I haven't done jack shit in 2023. Everything is nearly the same. But hey, at least nothing is worse than how it was a year ago. That might not feel like much right now but it's something.

Sorry for the gloomy thoughts. I've been feeling very unmotivated for anything lately, so much that even playing feels like a chore. I'm installing some new instrument plugins for FL Studio as I type this so hopefully finally having a mellotron to make cool music will cheer me up. That thing has such a cool noise <3

Oh and I discovered how Minecraft datapacks work! I can't believe I've been playing on Aternos servers crying about not having plugins when datapacks have existed this whole time. I owe them my life

For the code update, I added pagination to this page, the microblogs page, so I can put images and embeds on here without fear of bloating too much! To celebrate it, here's an embed of what I'm listening to right now. It's the trailer theme for the game Hypnospace Outlaw.
