I've added a new theme picker! Along with that, I've made 3 new themes, revamped the light theme and added a font picker as well! Now that I have a dedicated popup for the page settings I'll start working on the gif enabling/disabling thing.

Here's a list of the current themes:
- Andromeda: The default dark theme and the "true" theme. The site is built taking this theme in consideration first
- Ceres: The default light theme. Changed the colors a bit to make it purpler
- Orion: A dark red theme. It's meant to look cool rather than being fully accessible, I just think it's neat
- Eclipse: A higher contrast dark theme. No transparencies and no background to focus more on the content
- Nova: A higher contrast light theme. Same as above, not as high contrast because pure white burns my retinas

I like space, in case you didn't know

Oh and I didn't post the Homestuck thing I was making on 4/13 lmao, I considered rushing it but eh, fuck it ðŸ’ž

And I ended up becoming obsessed with Sky:CotL ðŸ˜”
