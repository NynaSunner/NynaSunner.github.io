Welp, my main hard drive is definitely dead. I lost so many personal files.

Crying aside, I didn't share what I wrote on the microblog I lost and it was pretty important news so I'm re-writting it here.

I moved to [Leprd](https://leprd.space/)! Their Winter Wind plan had free slots (it doesn't as of writting this) so I decided to join! The main reason why I want to move away from Github Pages is because I wanted to switch from Jekyll, a static site generator, to PHP. This should also help the site be lighter since it won't have the same header saved in 200 different pages. I plan on using [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) as my templating engine since it looks very similar to Liquid but I haven't looked much into it yet.

I can also have databases now, which is awesome since now I can host my own comments and style them however the hell I want! Fuck you, commentbox.io!

I also have a brand new domain! It's [nynasunner.space](https://nynasunner.space/)! I bought it with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), and it points to my site hosted on Leprd. The Github Pages site and url are still up right now, but they redirect to the new url. For now.

Oh, and in these PC-less days I've been working on two things. A [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) for spanish speakers that's still in the making, and a PokÃ©mon roleplay group with a few friends, also in spanish lol. Tbh I would have been crying in despair over the whole PC situation for the whole week if I didn't have rules and guides and designs to worry about.

Finally, for the code update, I've added a calendar heatmap to the microblogs page (this one!), I added it to a hidden page last week but I forgor ðŸ’€ to actually implement it. And I've changed the homepage to have a todo list instead of my latest posts, since I never post anything and having the same 2 sad old posts there for months was kinda sad ngl.
