On sunday I played Lethal Company with the bros. Played only one hour and refunded it because I'll barely have any chances of playing with them again and I'm poor asf. Still, it was fun and the game is really good so I'd buy it again in a heartbeat if I were able to play more. El vale se la come

I wish the bestiary was better tho, Sigurd's "non sense" is funny but I ended up relying more on guides for facing things like the bees

Also uhhh I did this days ago but I re-added the links section and put some Gintama resources there. MadaoBlooms asked me to put him in and I really want to but I'm still not sure where. Might do an honorary mentions thing, Mr. Blooms really deserves it
