Added a guestbook to the site and changed the comment widget from Disqus to HTML Comment Box. I wanted an alternative to Disqus for a while and I'm glad I found it. I also found [Ayano's comment widget](https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget), and though I like the idea of using Google docs I wanted a comment widget that allowed e-mail notifications.

I've found some really tempting hosting options, though. Will probably make my own comment widget with PHP if I move. God, I miss PHP

Also, yesterday I was about to catch my first Beakon in Palworld but the lights went out :(
