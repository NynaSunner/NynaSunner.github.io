I should've written this yesterday but uhhh I forgor ðŸ’€

After reading [this ACM article on seizure-inducing gifs online](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445510) I've decided to add freezeframe.js, so potentially dangerous gifs will only display on hover (or on click on mobile). The biggest offensor is the "your mom" banner I have right at the top of my index page, and while it's a placeholder for other banners (I had originally planed on making fake ads for my site but graphics design is not my passion) I've grown very attached to it, so I didn't want to let it go

I've also revamped the microblogs page so I don't need the pagination plugin (because since the pages were dynamic linking to a post would break eventually), which means that I can go back to posting my whole unbuilt code to Github and building from there, wooo! Which also means that I can post and edit stuff from my phone and other computers, wooohooo!!

The latter is specially cool because on monday I started a database admin course. It's for complete beginners, so since I already have some knowledge I can kill time now at the beginning by being productive on my site

Oh, and there's a Nintendo Direct tomorrow so I'm overdosing on hopium and getting my clown makeup ready for when they don't announce the FE4 remake
