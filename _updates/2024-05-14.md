Pushed all the changes I have been forgetting to for the last three weeks bruh.
- Adjusted font size to be in rem instead of pixels for better accessibility.
- Added a pic of da husbando (\*dies of cringe\*) to the about me page.
- Other small changes I already forgot about.. I'm a mess, as you can see

Also, I have just realized that the calendar heatmap doesn't work properly. All the dates before March are wrongly set to the next day. It seems that it doesn't take leap years into account but I dunno how to fix it.
