I needed to make my own poffin (those things from PokÃ©mon DPPT) calculator for Reasons to use somewhere else (it's a secret for now :3c), and since I already had the code I decided to include it in my site. I've only found one other properly functioning poffin calculator online so to add a twist for this one I decided to put everything in spanish, because translating the names of the berries is a pain in the ass.

Along with that I've moved the hex to percent calculator to a new page, the [tools](/misc/tools/) page, because I wanted each tool to have a description without having to go to their respective page and because if I stop being lazy they'd eventually flood the dropdown menu.

I'm currently cooking some stuff, one is a personal thing and the other is a resource though not coding related. They're both cringe, don't let me cook ever again ðŸ˜”

Oh and I'm currently obsessed with this video:
