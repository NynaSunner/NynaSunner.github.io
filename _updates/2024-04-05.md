Tweemoji died UGH, apparently fuckass Musk fired everyone who was working on it and the CDN they used finally died last month. Thankfully I found [this branch](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) that keeps being supported by former Twitter employees ([sauce](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji/issues/10#issuecomment-1487768059)) so I've switched to it.

I haven't posted shit in a good while and I haven't touched any code in this spring break but I've been working on some stuff. I got suddenly interested in classpects again (you know, the shit from fucking *Homestuck* [ewww] that's like the MBTI but cooler), so I asked a [friend](https://toyhou.se/bonrout) (love u bitch <3) for all their classpecting docs and notes and started writing a page for that info. It's not done yet, but I want to have it done by April 13th, on Homestuck day (cringe).

I've also been working on a shrine for FE4, I'm trying to make it look accurate and it's been hell but it's coming along so nicely, it's not finished yet but I'm already so proud of it :D

Oh and I've added Tippy.js to show tooltips in mobile. The way I was doing it before only used CSS but it overflowed to the right in mobile, so this'll fix it.
