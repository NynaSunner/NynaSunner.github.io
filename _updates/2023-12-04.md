I didn't add the tabs bruh but I don't need them anymore. Reworked the about me page a bunch of times last week and yesterday I decided that I preferred using AnchorJS for, you guessed it, the heading anchors

Finally got my Bluesky invite code, I still don't like microblogging-based social media but hey, at least it's not twitter. The feeds feature is still unpolished imo but it's good, *and* it's supposedly going federated soon, so even if I end up hating the ex-twitterdude's guts I can still see the stuff there from Mastodon. The mobile app sucks cocks and balls tho

Oh and guess who ended up writing a textwall defending Quan fireemblem again ðŸ˜”
