I tried installing the Wicked Whims mod for the Sims 4 and bro even with a thousand custom animations and shit it's so goofy, how can anyone watch these things moaning "shaloob" and think it's hot?

That aside I'm once again having the problem of not making my sims leave the house because travelling between lots without the open world TS3 had is a hassle. I hate not being able to manage the rest of my sims while I have one away doing whatever. Specially because their needs get messed up so the sim that was away is tired at midnight like usual but the others have half energy so now I have to fix their sleep schedule. If only the Sims 3 didn't have so many optimization issues
