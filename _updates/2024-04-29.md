This is going to be the last microblog as I do them now. I've decided to use this for site updates only and created a new [journal](/journal) page for personal stuff.

Remember when I said that I was going to make something Homestuck related for 4/13? And then didn't finish in time and never posted it? Well, I'm still not posting it because I haven't touched it again lol

What I did make and post was [a new tool](/tools/extended-zodiac) for calculating the score on each Aspect in the official Extended Zodiac test. The math was a pain in the ass and learning to use Chart.js was awful but it's done.
