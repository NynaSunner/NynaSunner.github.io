<h3>22/01/2024 🛠</h3>
<p>Yesterday I spent the whole afternoon playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">Palworld</a>. Despite it being called “pokémon but with guns” it actually is “ARK but with pokémon”. And I haven’t even unlocked guns yet bruh</p>

<p>I haven’t played much ARK before, and my experiences with it are basically playing normally for a few hours and then a massive dinosaur spawn camps us while destroying the base so we have to start anew somewhere else, so I’m really thankful that Pals are naturally passive so it can’t happen to me here. Managing items and Pals is also a lot easier than in ARK in the good way. The plant monkeys are OP.</p>

<p>I unlocked a bunch of fast travel points but I couldn’t beat the first tower. Dodging is pretty tight with some attacks. I feel like this is one of the games that becomes insanely better with multiplayer but none of my friends have a good enough PC to run the game 😔</p>

<p>Oh and I’ve seen a lot of people accuse this game of stealing from Pokémon and the designs being AI generated. I don’t think they’re AI since a good portion of the designs were shown in the reveal trailer back in 2021 when AI still sucked ass. Just look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/16wbw3c/dalle_mini_vs_dalle_2_vs_dalle_3/">how Dall-e has advanced since 2022</a>. It’s absurd how Pokémon fans have been accusing Palworld of being a ripoff as if the creature collecting and battling genre was copyrighted. And anything that does what Nintendon’t, or rather Game-Freakdon’t, and shows how lazy the new games are is a huge W imo.</p>

<p>For the code update I decided to move the theme toggler button to the navbar where it’s easier to access, renamed the “links” page to “resources” (since that’s what they really are even though it’s a link compilation), and moved the page update info to the footer where it truly belongs. Nothing big really.</p>


<h3>20/01/2024</h3>
<p>Not much has happened but it’s been a while since I last wrote here so I wanted to lol</p>

<p>I’ve been collecting all the fanstranslated FE4 and FE5 stuff (as in mangas and novels) I could find, because some of these can only be found through twitter posts from a while ago and trying to find anything on twitter is absolutely fucking terrible. I’ll probably make a post about it soon and add more links as more stuff is translated or uncovered.</p>

<p>My tamagotchi died today at 22 (kinda fucked up of him to die at the age I currently have but ok) and taking care of it these days made me think of how simple this virtual pet is. So I want to try and make a tamagotchi from scratch on pure JS, using cookies to save progress between sessions. No clue when I’ll actually move my lazy ass to do it tho lmao</p>

<p>And to add yet another completely unrelated topic to the list, yesterday morning I saw this fanart of Nanna and Leif and I’ve been giggling and kicking and squealing like a teenager every time I think about it</p>

<p>God, I love them so much</p>


<h3>10/01/2024</h3>
<p>We got <a href="https://youtu.be/Y_YYS8s8LxM?si=pBy-CpFSPNPFaKy9">a Thracia 776 banner in FEH</a>… But at what cost…</p>

<p>Ok I’m really happy about this banner, actually. They’re not characters I particularly like a lot, I would’ve loved to get Fergus or Dean or Selfina, but they’re still characters I like and at this point I’ll take any drop of Thracia content (or Jugdral content in general) and drink it like a dying man in the desert. Besides, Tina seems really fun to use and since she’s such an obscure character and her gimmick fits her and only her it’s very unlikely she’ll get powercrept anytyme soon. I’ll definitely be pulling for her and building Perne as well. <del>I need a break from building lance units bruh, sorry Arion</del></p>

<p>There’s a problem, though.</p>

<p><em>That man. The small hands man.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>The Reinhardt.</em></strong></p>

<p>I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t use or like Reinhard back then, he was easy to obtain and destroyed almost everything, but his days have been over for like two years now or maybe more. The meme was created organically and died organically as he stopped being relevant in the meta. So why is an unrecruitable character, a miniboss from a single chapter in Thracia 776, once again getting more alts than the main character? A main character who is in TWO Fire Emblem games?</p>

<p>Actually, Reinhardt having more alts than Leif <em>again</em> isn’t what I’m the most salty about. It’s about hIM GETTING A FOURTH ALT WHILE <strong><em>FINN</em></strong> ONLY HAS HIS BASE ONE!! Finn, my love, my beloved, mi amor, cuchurrumín, you’re too good for this world 💔</p>


<h3>03/01/2024 🛠</h3>
<p>Happy (belated) new year!</p>

<p>Honestly, the end of the year made me realize how I haven’t done jack shit in 2023. Everything is nearly the same. But hey, at least nothing is worse than how it was a year ago. That might not feel like much right now but it’s something.</p>

<p>Sorry for the gloomy thoughts. I’ve been feeling very unmotivated for anything lately, so much that even playing feels like a chore. I’m installing some new instrument plugins for FL Studio as I type this so hopefully finally having a mellotron to make cool music will cheer me up. That thing has such a cool noise &lt;3</p>

<p>Oh and I discovered how Minecraft datapacks work! I can’t believe I’ve been playing on Aternos servers crying about not having plugins when datapacks have existed this whole time. I owe them my life</p>

<p>For the code update, I added pagination to this page, the microblogs page, so I can put images and embeds on here without fear of bloating too much! To celebrate it, here’s an embed of what I’m listening to right now. It’s the trailer theme for the game Hypnospace Outlaw.</p>

<h3>26/12/2023</h3>
<p>I’ve been playing a bit of Pixelmon and a lot of Cobblemon this past week, though the seed of the Cobblemon server is super cursed so there’s nothing but ice and powder snow. God, how I hate powder snow. The snow is snowier than before.</p>

<p>Though some pokémon don’t look good in the cubic style I really like how Cobblemon looks. It’s definitely very new since some pokémon like eiscue drop four items on death and some drop nothing, the dex is very incomplete, berries barely have any use, etc. But it’s still very promising. A friend added a breeding mod and we managed to get mons with better natures and hidden abilities, though we’ve had no luck with shinies yet.</p>

<p>We added Terralith in the Cobblemon server since we had Biomes O’ Plenty in the Pixelmon one but it turned out to be a massive mistake since finding different biomes now is super hard, resulting in not seeing many different pokémon and making traveling a pain in the ass since Cobblemon doesn’t have riding like Pixelmon does, resulting in us having to trudge through the fucking powder snow.</p>

<p>Did I already mention that I hate powder snow?</p>
