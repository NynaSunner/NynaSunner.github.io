<h3>03/01/2024 🛠</h3>
<p>Happy (belated) new year!</p>

<p>Honestly, the end of the year made me realize how I haven’t done jack shit in 2023. Everything is nearly the same. But hey, at least nothing is worse than how it was a year ago. That might not feel like much right now but it’s something.</p>

<p>Sorry for the gloomy thoughts. I’ve been feeling very unmotivated for anything lately, so much that even playing feels like a chore. I’m installing some new instrument plugins for FL Studio as I type this so hopefully finally having a mellotron to make cool music will cheer me up. That thing has such a cool noise &lt;3</p>

<p>Oh and I discovered how Minecraft datapacks work! I can’t believe I’ve been playing on Aternos servers crying about not having plugins when datapacks have existed this whole time. I owe them my life</p>

<p>For the code update, I added pagination to this page, the microblogs page, so I can put images and embeds on here without fear of bloating too much! To celebrate it, here’s an embed of what I’m listening to right now. It’s the trailer theme for the game Hypnospace Outlaw.</p>

<h3>26/12/2023</h3>
<p>I’ve been playing a bit of Pixelmon and a lot of Cobblemon this past week, though the seed of the Cobblemon server is super cursed so there’s nothing but ice and powder snow. God, how I hate powder snow. The snow is snowier than before.</p>

<p>Though some pokémon don’t look good in the cubic style I really like how Cobblemon looks. It’s definitely very new since some pokémon like eiscue drop four items on death and some drop nothing, the dex is very incomplete, berries barely have any use, etc. But it’s still very promising. A friend added a breeding mod and we managed to get mons with better natures and hidden abilities, though we’ve had no luck with shinies yet.</p>

<p>We added Terralith in the Cobblemon server since we had Biomes O’ Plenty in the Pixelmon one but it turned out to be a massive mistake since finding different biomes now is super hard, resulting in not seeing many different pokémon and making traveling a pain in the ass since Cobblemon doesn’t have riding like Pixelmon does, resulting in us having to trudge through the fucking powder snow.</p>

<p>Did I already mention that I hate powder snow?</p>


<h3>17/12/2023</h3>
<p>I tried installing the Wicked Whims mod for the Sims 4 and bro even with a thousand custom animations and shit it’s so goofy, how can anyone watch these things moaning “shaloob” and think it’s hot?</p>

<p>That aside I’m once again having the problem of not making my sims leave the house because travelling between lots without the open world TS3 had is a hassle. I hate not being able to manage the rest of my sims while I have one away doing whatever. Specially because their needs get messed up so the sim that was away is tired at midnight like usual but the others have half energy so now I have to fix their sleep schedule. If only the Sims 3 didn’t have so many optimization issues</p>


<h3>09/12/2023 🛠</h3>
<p>Deployed the site on Github Pages again to see how it looked on mobile and since the abbr tooltips didn’t work I made my own, you can see one <abbr title="Tooltip!">here</abbr>!</p>

<p>Also, I’m salty about not getting any Thracia 776 banners in FEH this year, specially because I started playing it in like January of this year :(</p>

<h3>04/12/2023 🛠</h3>
<p>I didn’t add the tabs bruh but I don’t need them anymore. Reworked the about me page a bunch of times last week and yesterday I decided that I preferred using AnchorJS for, you guessed it, the heading anchors</p>

<p>Finally got my Bluesky invite code, I still don’t like microblogging-based social media but hey, at least it’s not twitter. The feeds feature is still unpolished imo but it’s good, <em>and</em> it’s supposedly going federated soon, so even if I end up hating the ex-twitterdude’s guts I can still see the stuff there from Mastodon. The mobile app sucks cocks and balls tho</p>

<p>Oh and guess who ended up writing a textwall defending Quan fireemblem again 😔</p>
