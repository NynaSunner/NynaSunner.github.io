Heya! You can call me <abbr tabindex="0" title="Pronounced nee-nah">Nyna</abbr>! I go by [they/them](https://en.pronouns.page/they%26they/them/themself) pronouns ([Ã©l/ella](https://pronombr.es/%C3%A9l%26ella) in spanish)

I'm a lazy ass junior web dev who lives in Spain, who prefers front-end dev and does almost exclusively vanilla JS, PHP, and CSS (Bootstrap is evil). So far I've only worked doing website layouts and I want to learn more about web design because, as you can see, I suck balls at it ðŸ˜”

Some of my hobbies are playing videogames, messing with FL Studio, bashing my head against a wall trying to learn about website design, modding, translating things for no reason, and getting into weird places online to find cool stuff

My native language is spanish, I learnt english mostly on my own so please correct me if I say anything wrong

I'm usually just chillin' so don't hesitate to hit me up, though I'm awful at trivial talk so please don't DM me if you don't have a conversation topic or a question, also please [don't just say "hi"](https://nohello.net/) and [don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)

## Some of my interests

**<u>Current fixation(s)</u>:** <abbr tabindex="0" title="Those are Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War, and Fire Emblem Thracia 776">the Jugdral FE games</abbr>, Dungeon Meshi, Sky: children of the Light
