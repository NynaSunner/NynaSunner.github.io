[Today I dreamt.](/journal/dreams#20240507)

There's a [new fallen heroes banner in FEH](). I generally don't care about fallen alts, the theme is cool but the only character I like who got one of these is Ninian and I wouldn't even call it "fallen" because she's just being mind controlled. So yeah, IDC because they're characters IDC about.

I cheered when I saw Nergal, immediately got disappointed when I realized that he was announced the third so he was the demote, cheered again when I saw his skills and saw that he wasn't, then got disappointed again at the fact that... He's getting a fallen alt. Instead of being a mythic hero. A main villain. Weird.

Oh well, at least he's in the game now. That's not my issue, though.

It's Lumera. Or rather, the fact that she has ***three alts*** now.

The same amount of alts as Seliph and Leif, who are ***protagonists*** and both from a ***28 year old game***. Leif even is playable in ***two*** games! Meanwhile Lumera is an NPC who dies in chapter 3 of her game and later reappears zombified as a map boss. She's from a game that came out ***a year ago***. And has three alts already. Sigh.

And once again Finn, who appears in both generations of FE4 and in FE5, still has just one singular alt from 2018.

I'm not even gonna talk about Ursula. It's clear that there's someone in the dev team who is down bad for her. Because what. the actual. fuck.

Shitting and crying about anime PNGs aside, the other day I went out with my parents to see one of the royal palaces. The actual palace tour was short, and the decoration was fucking ugly as expected, so where we spent most of the day was in the massive gardens that surround the palace.

I scanned a lot of flowers with my plant identifier app, we saw a lot of super loud peacocks (they sound like a cat in heat lmao), and allergies kicked my ass. Top 1 allergy provoked ass kicking in the last 3-ish years for sure.

The palace tour was funny though, there's a party dining room with a floor made of stucco which is a fucking stupid idea since it's super fragile. Stucco is only used in walls for a reason bruh. The royal toilets have a mural painted behind them so you couldn't actually see it while shitting. There's a room covered in porcelain filled with figures of chinese people doing various things and monkeys playing instruments. There's queen Isabel II's study and next to it BAM, POOL TABLE ROOM. And just hideous furniture and decoration after hideous furniture and decoration, with a lot of golden bronze and mahogany.

Just as I was writing this I got a ping and apparently the [Nintendo Switch 2 is real](https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197)? And it'll be properly announced sometime this year and will probably be released in 2025? And there's a Nintendo Direct in June? Man.

I never cared about the "Switch 2" rumors and didn't believe them but. Zamn.

Given that the wording is "the successor to Nintendo Switch" I assume that it will be like the 3DS to the DS or the WiiU to the Wii. So it likely has backward compatibility with regular Switch games. It could also be like the New 3DS to the 3DS and only have a few extra bells and whistles but I doubt it given that the Switch is like 8 years old.

Not gonna lie, the first thought my obsessed ass thought was "how will this affect the FE4 remake?". And I'm pretty worried about it. On one hand if this new Switch is significantly stronger than the old one then it'd be awesome if the remake was released there with better graphics and performance. On the other hand I don't want to buy a new console right now... Specially since I know that if the remake is exclusive to it I'll buy it instantly. I have the money because I save like a motherfucker but I'd still rather not spend the 300-ish euros it'll cost.

I hope they do like with Breath of the Wild and release it on both consoles (copium). I also hope the new Switch is easy to emulate and the game is made on Unity like Engage was so it's easy to datamine (weird ass copium). I just want to rip the sountrack and make mods ok
