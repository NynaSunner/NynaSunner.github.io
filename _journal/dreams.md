## 2024/05/07

I don't remember the beginning, just that I knew that there was a solar eclipse recently and that there was going to be a "lunar" eclipse (it was another solar one) soon that would kill half of the population (I didn't see the Infinity War similarity till now lol). I was in a bus with more people and they were aware of the looming apocalypse to some degree.

In the beginning I can't remember I tried to stop the eclipse from happening but failed, so me and the people in the bus resigned to simply watch the eclipse since there was nothing we could do. The bus driver (who was my paternal aunt I think?) drove closer to the edge of the cliff we were in to see it better, but moved too much and we fell.

I remember thinking "I hope she opens the door so we can leave the bus once we're in the water" while falling and it did happen. I took a breath before the bus sank and dove desperately to the door, which was easier than I expected, and resurfaced and swam back to shore. The "Thanos snap" happened while we were on the air and I was spared.

However, the shore was inhabited by Pals, like from Palworld, some were pretty high level and I didn't have any Pals so I stayed in the water by the edge of the shore to avoid getting mauled by chillets and bolthounds. I vaguely remember seeing the bodies of some chillets that died in the apocalypse but I don't remember what I thought about them.

I very vaguely remember someone else being with me and hitting a level 10 Pal with a stick to weaken it but we didn't have any Pal spheres, so they couldn't catch it and I didn't understand why they were trying to weaken the Pal then.

Then the dream shifts and I'm in a vaguely post-apocalyptic setting with pokémon in Cobblemon's cubic style. There was more people and we had like 5 pokéballs each and no pokémon yet. The amount of pokéballs was very limited but I don't remember much else. I saw a tinkaton and tried catching it (they were very rare) but some jerk caught it after I failed twice. Another one spawned but I woke up before I could try catching it.
