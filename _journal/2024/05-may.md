## Tuesday 7th

- Mood: üòî Malding over a fucking gatcha game
- Weather: ‚òÄÔ∏è Cold for this time of the year
- Video OTD: [Lebron James scream if you love Lethal Company](https://youtu.be/zKmTHH3tkvE)

[Today I dreamt.](/journal/dreams#20240507)

There's a [new fallen heroes banner in FEH](). I generally don't care about fallen alts, the theme is cool but the only character I like who got one of these is Ninian and I wouldn't even call it "fallen" because she's just being mind controlled. So yeah, IDC because they're characters IDC about.

I cheered when I saw Nergal, immediately got disappointed when I realized that he was announced the third so he was the demote, cheered again when I saw his skills and saw that he wasn't, then got disappointed again at the fact that... He's getting a fallen alt. Instead of being a mythic hero. A main villain. Weird.

Oh well, at least he's in the game now. That's not my issue, though.

It's Lumera. Or rather, the fact that she has ***three alts*** now.

The same amount of alts as Seliph and Leif, who are ***protagonists*** and both from a ***28 year old game***. Leif even is playable in ***two*** games! Meanwhile Lumera is an NPC who dies in chapter 3 of her game and later reappears zombified as a map boss. She's from a game that came out ***a year ago***. And has three alts already. Sigh.

And once again Finn, who appears in both generations of FE4 and in FE5, still has just one singular alt from 2018.

I'm not even gonna talk about Ursula. It's clear that there's someone in the dev team who is down bad for her. Because what. the actual. fuck.

Shitting and crying about anime PNGs aside, the other day I went out with my parents to see one of the royal palaces. The actual palace tour was short, and the decoration was fucking ugly as expected, so where we spent most of the day was in the massive gardens that surround the palace.

I scanned a lot of flowers with my plant identifier app, we saw a lot of super loud peacocks (they sound like a cat in heat lmao), and allergies kicked my ass. Top 1 allergy provoked ass kicking in the last 3-ish years for sure.

The palace tour was funny though, there's a party dining room with a floor made of stucco which is a fucking stupid idea since it's super fragile. Stucco is only used in walls for a reason bruh. The royal toilets have a mural painted behind them so you couldn't actually see it while shitting. There's a room covered in porcelain filled with figures of chinese people doing various things and monkeys playing instruments. There's queen Isabel II's study and next to it BAM, POOL TABLE ROOM. And just hideous furniture and decoration after hideous furniture and decoration, with a lot of golden bronze and mahogany.

Just as I was writing this I got a ping and apparently the [Nintendo Switch 2 is real](https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197)? And it'll be properly announced sometime this year and will probably be released in 2025? And there's a Nintendo Direct in June? Man.

I never cared about the "Switch 2" rumors and didn't believe them but. Zamn.

Given that the wording is "the successor to Nintendo Switch" I assume that it will be like the 3DS to the DS or the WiiU to the Wii. So it likely has backward compatibility with regular Switch games. It could also be like the New 3DS to the 3DS and only have a few extra bells and whistles but I doubt it given that the Switch is like 8 years old.

Not gonna lie, the first thought my obsessed ass thought was "how will this affect the FE4 remake?". And I'm pretty worried about it. On one hand if this new Switch is significantly stronger than the old one then it'd be awesome if the remake was released there with better graphics and performance. On the other hand I don't want to buy a new console right now... Specially since I know that if the remake is exclusive to it I'll buy it instantly. I have the money because I save like a motherfucker but I'd still rather not spend the 300-ish euros it'll cost.

I hope they do like with Breath of the Wild and release it on both consoles (copium). I also hope the new Switch is easy to emulate and the game is made on Unity like Engage was so it's easy to datamine (weird ass copium). I just want to rip the soundtrack and make mods ok

# Monday 13th

- Mood: üí§ Eepy
- Weather: ‚òÄÔ∏è Oddly hot at night
- Video OTD: [Super Mario 64 "unused" starman theme]()

I feel like I've only slept decently once in the past 3 weeks bruh

When I woke up today I was so unusually half asleep, I'm usually sleepy until I get dressed but now I was barely awake enough to turn off the alarm, which is super weird since I usually wake up like half an hour earlier than my alarm.

It's not hotter than usual (the usual being "hotter than it should be for May") but the nights sure are. My legs still feel sticky from sweat. I want to go home and shower so badly.

At least the weather is hot now and not last week, because the drainage water pipes in my building were completely rotten so we spent several days without water supply for 10 hours a day. Definitely not fun.

Oh, and my new headphones finally arrived! I got the [HyperX Cloud Alpha](https://row.hyperx.com/products/hyperx-cloud-alpha) after scrolling for a good while through r/HeadphoneAdvice and seeing that it was the most recommended headset that fit my specifications and that was available.

What I wanted was for a headset with a detachable mic, closed back, no active noise cancelling, over-ear, and wired with the possibility of changing the cable (since that's from were all my headphones have broken in the past). These headphones have a bit too much passive noise cancelling for my liking and the cable is ridiculously long but everything else is perfect and awesome so far. :)

They also come with a split cable to connect to your PC's sound card, which is great since I haven't had the chance to use it yet lmao. It's a kinda shitty one but it's better than nothing.

Some days ago me and a few friends wanted to play some Minecraft while we waited for the Cobblemon mod to update. I tried making a server with Pixelmon and a shitton of optimization mods but it worked like ass, so we switched to trying to make a server with the DarkRPG modpack.

I spent a very good while trying to get it to run in my Raspberry Pi, I had to join the modpack's Discord server for extra files to make it work (IF YOU MAKE ME JOIN A DISCORD SERVER TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE JUST UPLOADED TO MEDIAFIRE I AM LEGALLY ALLOWED TO KILL YOU), and later cried blood because some mods didn't work because they couldn't locate the SQLite libraries (which I did have bruh) so I had to delete all the mods that made any allusions to databases.

It finally worked but it was laggy as fuck. Less than one minute after getting it to run I get informed that Aternos lets you use popular modpacks and DarkRPG is one of those. Rage hatred destruction explosions for one thousand years

So we played on Aternos, with the chunk generation being slow as fuck, looking for a cool biome to build our base in aaaand two days later Cobblemon updates. So no more playing on that server I guess. :xd:

I made the Cobblemon server yesterday evening. I tried to add Origins mods and datapacks to spice it up but we were using the official Cobblemon modpack and Aternos is a massive bitch so I couldn't in the end. Sad, I wanted to be a moth.

We haven't made any pok√©balls yet but I found a flower forest biome and a village next to it; it was a great place so I started building my house there. I'm tired of doing the same medieval house all the time and I've always wanted to make a house in the side of a mountain or hill so that's what I'm doing now. The lower floor is the base of the hill and the highest one is the top of the hill. I explain myself like ass, I know.

<div class="center"><img src="/assets/img/divider.gif"></div>

I've also been planning on joining a pok√©mon trainers roleplay server with some friends. We have a common theme going on that I don't want to reveal just in case :3c

But the thing is, this time it didn't take me fucking forever to make a character and design and to communicate them for Deu to draw for me (they still owe me like 7 drawings hehe), which is cool since that means that I'm getting better at birthing characters. Probably.

For reference, last time it took me half a year to make an OC for a group. In my defense I've never been an OC person and he is literally the first proper character I've ever had.

I don't have a backstory for my new trainer OC yet tho lol that's a problem for future me üíÖ

## Tuesday 14th

- Mood: üò∑ Allergic as FUCK
- Weather: üå§Ô∏è Kinda cool and windy
- Video OTD: See below

No real entry today. I just saw this rip and fucking pogged so I had to put it here.

<div class="center"><iframe class="ytvideo" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TmtWITllnvw?si=uX9LuJx9EEjldjF2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Oh and today is the 28th anniversary of Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War. What an awesome game with jank gameplay and amazing story. Thracia 776's 25th anniversary is later this year but dunno when.

Well, typing that and not checking when I'm in front of a fucking computer is super lame so I looked it up and <abbr title="The deluxe edition came out earlier, in August 28th, but it's not the one listed in Wikipedia so idc">it's on September 1st</abbr>. Right after my birthday! More reasons to commission some fanart to celebrate, hehe.

But back to FE4, the lack of the remake when it has supposedly been finished for a good while now is *still* driving me up the wall. Stop holding it hostage, Nintendo.
