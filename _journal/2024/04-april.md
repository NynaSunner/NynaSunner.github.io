## Monday 29th

- Mood: ðŸ§¶ Headache
- Weather: ðŸŒ¤ Cold
- Video OTD: [Everyone Knows That (SFW version)](https://youtu.be/_rd4euNwCvo)

Oh my god trying to make this thing was AWFUL because I'm stupid and kept overcomplicating stuff. I thought about using collections for each day, remembered that there's no way to automatically generate a page per month like this one, tried doing everything manually, thought that was stupid (because in programming the more you automate shit the better you are), asked fucking ChatGPT to write me a plugin that *did work* but made Jekyll go crazy and regenerate infinitely, cleaned up the mess, fought Liquid to make it group the months per year, and here we are now.

So the main reason why I'm splitting the microblog into site updates and journal/diary is because mixing the two was kinda weird to begin with, because it lets me write this stuff in more length, and because since this is fully personal and not displayed on the landing page I can slap an NSFW warning and talk about whatever the fuck I want, however the fuck I want.

Also because I'm <s>a pussy</s> shy so I wanted my most personal stuff to be harder to find.

In the evening stupid ass Windows decided to update without my permission so I lost all the shit I had in incognito grrr. I use Firefox for normal browsing and Chrome for incognito but I'm starting to get ads in youtube despite having an adblocker, so it's finally time to boot Chrome and only use it to check compatibility in web stuff. Might consider switching it for Googleless Chrome or something like that too.

## Tuesday 30th

- Mood: ðŸ’¦ Shivering
- Weather: ðŸŒ¤ A lot warmer than yesterday
- Video OTD: [Arvis' Ultimatum](https://youtu.be/ZzUth1mKMwI?si=2AhPPUsbCEcAFzhi)

I forgot to farm hearts in Sky:COTL yesterday hhhhhhhh

Anyway, I didn't wanna write two consecutive days because that's cringe but this is literally the last day of the month and it'd be too sad if I only had one singular entry in this month. Besides, I didn't get to post it yesterday so who cares.

Didn't sleep well last night, it wasn't awful but definitely not good. I feel like I dreamt but I don't remember anything. It took me forever to fall asleep.

Anyway nothing happened between today and yesterday so here's Mr. Babygirl himself.
