Here's some extra info about Classpecting.

## States

Since Classpect is marked by development, they have different "states" depending on how much the player has grown or failed to grow.

### Low/mid/high levels

Some people use the term "at low levels" as a synonym to the beginning of their development, and you can guess the other two. This is because SBURB is a videogame and the Echeladder is the leveling system.

### Successful

A successful player is one who has reached the objective of their Classpect. They've unlocked all their powers, they've found balance, they're moisturized, happy, in their lane, flourishing. [/ref](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/unbothered-moisturized-happy-in-my-lane-focused-flourishing)

### Failed

A failed player is one who has failed to succeed and fallen into the bad habits of their Classpect.

### Inverted

Inversion is the act of a player acting like a failed version of their opposite Class and Aspect. Usually triggered by a big crisis, this state is extremely unhealthy and destructive, both for the player suffering it and those around them.

## SBURB stuff

I'll probs move this to the SBURB section once I make it.

### Knights in SBURB

A SUBRB session will have a lack of the Knight's aspect. The beta kids' session is rushed and they have a Knight of Time (Dave), and the beta trolls' session has a lack of unity and they have a Knight of Blood (Karkat).

The knight makes up for this with their role and biggest strength, which is to exploit their Aspect. They instinctually know how to milk it and abuse it to win. Dave abuses time travel to do things faster, and to effectively make clones of himself and defeat harder enemies earlier.

### Knight and Space in SBURB

The Knight and the Space player have a very particular extra role in a game of SBURB. They must breed the Genesis Frog.

The Space player's land will always include frogs in its title (Land of Frost and Frogs, Land of Rays and Frogs). And it will, indeed, be filled with frogs. The Knight must aid the Space player in gathering the frogs and breeding them to create one with the perfect genetic code, the Genesis Frog. This is required to succeed and win SBURB, as the Genesis Frog will host the new universe.

(As you can guess, a Knight of Space would have to do the breeding alone. This is likely too much work for one person and generally considered to be extremely difficult or straight up doomed to fail).

Aditionally, the Forge will be in the Space player's planet. Lighting the Forge alters the planet in some way and it's apparently needed for progressing, or at least for breeding (in LOFAF awakening the volcano was needed to thaw the frozen frogs).

## Misc

### Upper Aspect wheel vs lower Aspect wheel

The Aspects wheel can be split into two halves: the upper half and the lower half.
- **Upper**: Space, Mind, Hope, Breath, Life, and Light.
- **Lower**: Time, Heart, Rage, Blood, Doom, and Void.

These are some characteristics that are shared by Aspects of the same half:
- Upper half:
    - Lean more towards Prospit.
    - Tend to have symbolisms that are more conceptual and abstract.
- Lower half:
    - Lean more towards Derse.
    - Tend to have symbolisms that are more real and material.

### Overlapping Classpect

Some Classes have a description that leans very heavily towards an specific Aspect and vice versa. Here are some I've found:

- Mage of Light
    - Active knowledge Class + knowledge and relevance Aspect.
- Knight of Heart
    - Self image issues Class + feelings and self Aspect.
- Maid of Rage
    - Setting down your foot and saying no Class + rebellion and saying no Aspect.
- Maid of Space
    - Creation Class + creativity Aspect.
- Seer of Life
    - Guiding others to what you never had Class + money, luxury, energy, and health Aspect.
- Seer/Mage of Doom
    - Guiding Class + wisdom Aspect.
