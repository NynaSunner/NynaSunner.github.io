Here's some extra info about Classpecting.

## States

Since Classpect is marked by development, they have different "states" depending on how much the player has grown or failed to grow.

### Low/mid/high levels

Some people use the term "at low levels" as a synonym to the beginning of their development, and you can guess the other two. This is because SBURB is a videogame and the Echeladder is the leveling system.

### Successful

A successful player is one who has reached the objective of their Classpect. They've unlocked all their powers, they've found balance, they're moisturized, happy, in their lane, flourishing. [/ref](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/unbothered-moisturized-happy-in-my-lane-focused-flourishing)

### Failed

A failed player is one who has failed to succeed and fallen into the bad habits of their Classpect.

### Inverted

Inversion is the act of a player acting like a failed version of their opposite Class and Aspect. Usually triggered by a big crisis, this state is extremely unhealthy and destructive, both for the player suffering it and those around them.

## Master Classes: Lord and Muse

There are actually two more Classes shown in Homestuck: the extremely active Lord Class and the extremely passive Muse Class.

These Classes are ***not*** for humans, period. They're for ***gods***. You can't be either of these Classes. If you consider yourself one you're a self-absorbed Mary Sue, full offense.

That's why I don't cover them here. They're way too extreme. Master Classes are more a force of the universe than anything, they're extremely consumed and defined by their Aspect, having ultimate control of it. You can even say they *are* their Aspect.

Lords do it in a way that benefits themselves and *only* themselves. Muse is harder since the only canon Muse is a Muse of Space and it's hard to tell if the inspiration part of it comes from Muse or from Space, but we can say that Muses inspire others through their Aspect extremely passively, just by existing, in a way that only benefits others.

"But can I Classpect characters as Lord/Muse?" Yes, but even if you go for godlike ones they won't be a Master Class 99.9% of the time. The only "character" I've seen be correctly assigned a Master Class is [SCP-2747](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747), as a Lord of Void.

## SBURB stuff

I'll probs move this to the SBURB section once I make it.

### Knights in SBURB

A SUBRB session will have a lack of the Knight's aspect. The beta kids' session is rushed and they have a Knight of Time (Dave), and the beta trolls' session has a lack of unity and they have a Knight of Blood (Karkat).

The knight makes up for this with their role and biggest strength, which is to exploit their Aspect. They instinctually know how to milk it and abuse it to win. Dave abuses time travel to do things faster, and to effectively make clones of himself and defeat harder enemies earlier; Karkat is less successful but he still uses the bonds he has with his friends to bring them all together.

### Knight and Space in SBURB

The Knight and the Space player have a very particular extra role in a game of SBURB. They must breed the Genesis Frog.

The Space player's land will always include frogs in its title (Land of Frost and Frogs, Land of Rays and Frogs). And it will, indeed, be filled with frogs. The Knight must aid the Space player in gathering the frogs and breeding them to create one with the perfect genetic code, the Genesis Frog. This is required to succeed and win SBURB, as the Genesis Frog will host the new universe.

(As you can guess, a Knight of Space would have to do the breeding alone. This is likely too much work for one person and generally considered to be extremely difficult or straight up doomed to fail).

Aditionally, the Forge will be in the Space player's planet. Lighting the Forge alters the planet in some way and it's apparently needed for progressing, or at least for breeding (in LOFAF awakening the volcano was needed to thaw the frozen frogs).

## Misc

### Upper Aspect wheel vs lower Aspect wheel

The Aspects wheel can be split into two halves: the upper half and the lower half.
- **Upper**: Space, Mind, Hope, Breath, Life, and Light.
- **Lower**: Time, Heart, Rage, Blood, Doom, and Void.

These are some characteristics that are shared by Aspects of the same half:
- Upper half:
    - Lean more towards Prospit.
    - Tend to have symbolisms that are more conceptual and abstract.
- Lower half:
    - Lean more towards Derse.
    - Tend to have symbolisms that are more real and material.

### Most common Classes and Aspects

The most common classes are the ones in the commoner archetype, while the ones in the noble archetype are the rarest ones. Out of the commoner classes, though, Knight and Rogue are more common, with Knight being the most common. Prince and Bard are the rarest Classes with Bard being the rarest by far.

For the Aspects it's harder to determine how common they are. Heart is definitely the most common, followed by Blood; while Doom is the rarest.

Knight of Heart is, indeed, the most common Classpect.

### Common misconceptions

- It's commonly said that "Space is art and Time is music". This makes no sense since music is art so it'd belong to Space. This all stems from Dave making music and Aradia using music boxes (but Dave specifically makes mixes, highlighting the repetition aspect of Time, and Aradia's music boxes highlight the mechanical aspect), and from wrongfully equating creativity to art.

### Overlapping Classpect

Some Classes have a description that leans very heavily towards an specific Aspect and vice versa. Here are some I've found:

- Mage of Light
    - Active knowledge Class + knowledge and relevance Aspect.
- Knight of Heart
    - Self image issues Class + feelings and self Aspect.
- Maid of Rage
    - Setting down your foot and saying no Class + rebellion and saying no Aspect.
- Maid of Space
    - Creation Class + creativity Aspect.
- Seer of Life
    - Guiding others to what you never had Class + money, luxury, energy, and health Aspect.
- Seer/Mage of Doom
    - Guiding Class + wisdom Aspect.
