- English is not my first language and Homestuck is written in a very "unfriendly" way. Understanding the writing takes me a lot of effort and I might understand or interpret it wrongly.
- If my tone is different in this page compared to the rest it's because I hate Homestuck and talking about it makes me more snarky.

## Homestuck? Ewwww.

Yeah, I think the same.

## Seriously, why Homestuck?

Because as cringe and atrocious as it is, it's important to me. I made a lot of friends through an specific Homestuck community, many of which I still talk to and are very dear to me. We rarely talk about Homestuck anymore but it still is what brought us together.

Plus I'm a sucker for weird and original worldbuilding. Which is what this page is about!

Also, I like to believe I'm superior to the average Homestuck fan by not caring about the annoying part, the characters, and by not being a Vriska apologist or a Dirk whore. I hate Dirk.

## Will you tell me about Homestuck?

Only the parts I give a fuck about. These are:
- Classpects
- SBURB mechanics
- Troll society and biology

You won't see me talking about the characters (except as references) because I generally don't care or like them much. If you're wondering, though, my fave is John. He's baby. Karkat has my favorite classpect for characters so I like him too. Knight gang ü§ù

I won't even mention the Epilogue or Homestuck^2 because I haven't bothered to read about how they keep massacring the story and the characters, and it's not even truly canon. It doesn't have anything from the list above so I'm not missing on anything anyway. Damn Homestuck writters, they ruined Homestuck!

Btw I fucking hate Dirk.

## Didn't you say you hate Homestuck?

Yes. I hate it. But I like it. I'm like this meme:

## What's your classpect? And Sign?

- Class: Knight
- Aspect: Space
- Moon: Prospit
- Caste: Jadeblood

Therefore my classpect is Knight of Space and my sign is True Virgo (Jade + Space + Prospit).

## A True Sign? That's cringe.

Look I didn't ask to be born in late August ok
