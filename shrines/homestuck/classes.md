In canon it's mentioned that some classes are gender locked, then years later Hussie said they're not. I follow canon above what Hussie says on Twitter, but in this topic I don't care too much. I haven't found any exceptions to the rule yet, but if it happens then it happens.

## Thief

- Active +6
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who steals Aspect or steals through Aspect to benefit themselves

## Prince

- Active +5
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who destroys Aspect or destroys through Aspect to benefit themselves

I honestly don't know jack shit about destructive classes.

## Witch

- Active +4
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Feminine
> One who manipulates Aspect or manipulates through Aspect to benefit themselves

Very powerful but very hated (and for a good reason).

If being a "manipulating" Class sounds bad it's because it kind of is. Witches believe they know what's best and will manipulate others to attain their goals. They might believe it's the best for the whole group, but most of the time they're only benefitting themselves or seeing things only through their own point of view.

## Mage

- Active +3
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Neutral
> One who knows Aspect or knows through Aspect to benefit themselves

A Mage once described to me their own class as "the most autistic one". It's not correct but I get what they were trying to say.

It's commonly said that a Mage "suffers" their aspect. Some try to argue that it's not true, but it is. However, most of the time it's the Mage's own fault.

As a knowledge class, a Mage's goal is to learn about their aspect. And how do they do it? By pure trial and error. While Seers learn by studying, Mages learn through practise. They will shove a metal fork into an electric socket for the sake of knowledge.

Their inversion is the [Sylph](#sylph), where they give up and desperately try to manipulate their opposite Aspect.

## Maid

- Active +2
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Feminine
> One who provides Aspect or provides through Aspect to benefit themselves

I like to describe Maid as "doormat to girlboss".

A Maid starts off relying on others for their own aspect. A Maid of Hope will believe what others tell them to, a Space one will create the way others tell them to, a blood one will form bonds in the way others tell them to. Pushovers, basically.

Their goal is to learn to rely on themselves, they're more than capable to handle themselves even if they don't believe they are.

Powers wise, Maids create their aspect.

Their inversion is the [Bard](#bard), where they reject their own Aspect and start destroying it.

## Knight

- Active +1
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who exploits Aspect or exploits through Aspect to benefit themselves

Saw it described as "toxic masculinity Class". Honestly? True.

As my own Class it's the one I know the most about lol. Also I swear it's not as edgy as it sounds.

Knights go through a traumatic event (not necessarily a PTSD inducing one) that causes them to become insecure about a part of themselves, in this case part of their Aspect, which makes them try to hide behind a mask.

Some people refer to the behavior of a Knight hiding themselves as "turtling". Like a turtle hiding in its shell. Safe from the outside world, safe from further harm, safe from judgement.

A Knight's goal is to overcome their insecurities and take off their mask, showing who they truly are to the world.

Knights in SBURB have the role of helping the Space player breed the Genesis frog, needed to win the game. It's also theorised that a session will lack the Knight's Aspect, since the beta kids' session is rushed and they have a Knight of Time, and the beta trolls' session has a lack of unity and they have a Knight of Blood.

This last point should not be an issue if the Knight does their job, since their power is to exploit their aspect. They will take whatever little of their Aspect there is and milk it 'til it's dry. They know what they need and where to get it and they will optimize the hell out of it.

Knights also seem to have or gain a little of their God Tier powers before ascending.

Their inversion is the [Rogue](#rogue), where they are at their most insecure and start gifting their opposite Aspect.

## Rogue

- Passive -1
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who steals Aspect or steals through Aspect to benefit others

Rogues are about redistribution. A Rogue starts off by not trusting themselves with their aspect, so they give it to others. If those others are assholes this can end badly for the Rogue.

A rogue's goal is to be confident in their own abilities and start using their Aspect instead of giving it away freely.

Their inversion is the [Knight](#knight), where they try to hide their flaws and be someone they're not.

## Bard

- Passive -2
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who destroys Aspect or destroys through Aspect to benefit others

I honestly don't know jack shit about destructive classes.

## Sylph

- Passive -3
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Feminine
> One who manipulates Aspect or manipulates through Aspect to benefit others

Sylphs are concerned about the others' wellbeing. This sounds cute, but remember that this is a manipulation Class.

Basically, a Sylph believes they know what's best for the others. They will try to help

## Seer

- Passive -4
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Neutral
> One who knows Aspect or knows through Aspect to benefit others

Seers come from a background that lacks their Aspect. A Seer of Blood came from a broken family, a Seer of Life came from poverty, a Seer of Rage came from blind faith.

It is this lack of their aspect that drives them to learn about it. They will study it, they can't experiment with it like Mages do since they lack it around them, and will use that knowledge to guide others to what they never had. To avoid having them make the same mistakes.

This, however, can make the Seer bitter.

## Heir

- Passive -5
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who provides Aspect or provides through Aspect to benefit others

A Heir embodies their aspect. They swim in that thang. However that can make them have a pretty toxic relationship with their own Aspect

A Heir's goal is to find the balance with their aspect and not let themselves be consumed by it.
