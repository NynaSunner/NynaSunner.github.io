In canon it's mentioned that some classes are gender locked, then years later Hussie said they're not. I follow canon above what Hussie says on Twitter, but in this topic I don't care too much. I haven't found any exceptions to the rule yet, but if it happens then it happens.

## Thief

- Active +6
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who steals Aspect or steals through Aspect to benefit themselves

## Prince

- Active +5
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who destroys Aspect or destroys through Aspect to benefit themselves

I honestly don't know jack shit about destructive classes.

## Witch

- Active +4
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Feminine
> One who manipulates Aspect or manipulates through Aspect to benefit themselves

Very powerful but very hated (and for a good reason).

Witches start off by rebelling against their Aspect, but unlike other Classes, instead of rejecting it they manipulate and twist it to their liking as if it were a toy they can play with.

Despite this rebellion, they're naturally good at their aspect and their ability to manipulate it comes easily to them, but with great power comes great responsbility.

This manipulation is done with no moral sense and by not caring about the consequences. This makes Witches a force to be reckoned with, but also makes them someone who can easily hurt those around them without realizing.

Witches typically tend to be energetic and volatile, which can make exercising self-control a lot harder for them. They also tend to be interested or attracted by their opposite Aspect.

Their goal is to understand the consequences their manipulation have on others, and learn moderation and morality.

Their inversion is the [Seer](#seer)

## Mage

- Active +3
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Neutral
> One who knows Aspect or knows through Aspect to benefit themselves

A Mage once described to me their own class as "the most autistic one". It's not correct but I get what they were trying to say.

It's commonly said that a Mage "suffers" their Aspect, but the more correct word would be "experimenting". However, this experimenting sure does bring a lot of suffering to the Mage. It's usually their own fault, though.

As a knowledge class, a Mage's goal is to learn about their aspect. And how do they do it? By pure trial and error. While Seers learn by studying, Mages learn through practice and personal experiences. They will throw themselves to their aspect to learn. They know not to shove a metal fork into an electric socket because they've already done it.

It is because they learn about their aspect so personally, by feeling it in their bones, that they're so knowledgeable about it.

Mages understand their aspect, but they aren't good at explaining it to others. Which is why the Mage has an active role as a guide. They're about using their own knowledge to guide, not about sharing it like the Seer does.

Mages tend to be paranoid and afraid of making mistakes, because bad things happen when they're wrong, which can render them frozen and unable to act and progress. Mages also tend to be very stubborn, believing that their problems can be solved by trying again and again no matter how much they suffer in the process. The more failed they are the more their perspective on their aspect is reinforced and the more they refuse to accept other points of view (and thus, not changing their ways and preventing them from learning further).

Their goal is to understand that this paranoia is bad for them, and to open their mind to other points of view besides their own.

Their inversion is the [Sylph](#sylph), where they become afraid of their own Aspect and desperately try to manipulate their opposite Aspect.

## Maid

- Active +2
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Feminine
> One who provides Aspect or provides through Aspect to benefit themselves

I like to describe Maid as "doormat to girlboss".

A Maid's growth is, like the Bard's, split into two parts: dependency and balance.

A Maid starts off relying on others for their own aspect. They tend to be submissive and obedient (like an actual maid), and haven't formed their own criterion on their aspect. Because of this, they're insecure on their opinion on their own Aspect, and seek validation and for others to tell them what to do. They live to serve others (again, like a maid).

Here, a Maid can completely disregard themselves for the sake of blindly following orders.

However, as the Maid grows, they start to develop their own idea of what their Aspect is without having someone else tell them. They start to focus on their own needs and wants, becoming more confident and “““egoistical””” and starting to refuse to serve when they don't want to. They become independent.

Maids are typically selfless and compassionate, and as they develop they grow to have a very strong character. Firm, confident, determined, and just.

Refusing to serve altogether makes Maids grow bitter and fall into self-loathing, or even becoming destructive and a rebel.

Their goal is to strike the balance between serving others and serving themselves. Fulfilling their role by providing but knowing when to say "no", and being independent to confidently be themselves.

Powers wise, Maids create their aspect.

Their inversion is the [Bard](#bard), where they reject their own Aspect and start destroying it.

## Knight

- Active +1
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who exploits Aspect or exploits through Aspect to benefit themselves

Saw it described as "toxic masculinity Class". Honestly? True.

Knights have suffered a deep, personal wound (sometimes even referred to as a trauma) that causes them to become insecure about a part of themselves, in this case part of their Aspect, which makes them hide their true selves behind a mask.

They will try to only show their best side, often by overcompensating with other parts of their own Aspect. Hiding their insecurities, Knights struggle opening up to others, asking for help, and showing weakness.

Some people refer to the behavior of a Knight hiding themselves as "turtling". Like a turtle hiding in its shell. Safe from the outside world, safe from judgement, safe from further harm.

A Knight's goal is to overcome their insecurities and take off their mask, showing who they truly are to the world.

Knights in SBURB have the added role of helping the Space player breed the Genesis Frog, needed to win the game. Also, a session will lack the Knight's Aspect (since the beta kids' session is rushed and they have a Knight of Time, and the beta trolls' session has a lack of unity and they have a Knight of Blood).

This last point should not be an issue if the Knight does their job, since their power is to exploit their aspect. They will take whatever little of their Aspect there is and milk it 'til it's dry. They know what they need and where to get it and they will optimize the hell out of it.

Knights are naturally skilled in using their aspect, and they also seem to have or gain a little of their God Tier powers before Ascending.

Their inversion is the [Rogue](#rogue), where they are at their most insecure and start gifting their opposite Aspect.

## Rogue

- Passive -1
- Archetype: Commoner
- Gender: Neutral
> One who steals Aspect or steals through Aspect to benefit others

More than a "stealing" class, Rogues are about redistribution. They take when there's an excess to give when there's insufficence.

A Rogue starts off by not trusting themselves with their Aspect, often due to self-esteem issues, so they give it to others. They don't give it to anyone, though, they're selective and only give it to those they see fit. Being the most active of the passive Classes, the Rogue prioritizes loved ones and people they like, and are often quite protective of them.

Rogues dislike their Aspect in its purest form, and specially hate experiencing that themselves, so they might appear as their opposite or a different Aspect. Because of this they often seek the balance between their own and their opposite Aspect.

Despite this, failed Rogues isolate themselves, often using a symbolysm of their Aspect.

A Rogue's goal is to be confident in their own abilities and start keeping some of their Aspect, instead of giving it all away.

Their inversion is the [Knight](#knight), where they try to isolate themselves and hide their true self behind their opposite Aspect.

## Bard

- Passive -2
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who destroys Aspect or destroys through Aspect to benefit others

Most uncomprehensible class ever. No one knows what the hell is wrong with Bards.

## Sylph

- Passive -3
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Feminine
> One who manipulates Aspect or manipulates through Aspect to benefit others

The "mom friend" Class (there are only two paragraphs on this one in my docs, sorry).

Sylphs are concerned about the others' wellbeing. This sounds cute, but remember that this is a manipulation Class.

Sylphs *love* meddling. They'll make your problems their own and try to fix them how they see fit. They believe they know what's best for the others. They're healers, but you might not like the cure.

Unlike Witches, their manipulation is passive. They'll gently nudge others to where they want them to be, and they do it only because they want the best for the others. They're actually pretty good at helping and healing, however focusing on their role too much can lead to burnout.

For Sylphs the end justifies the means.

A Sylph's goal is to understand that they're not always right, and to stop meddling so much.

Their inversion is the [Mage](#mage), where they become extremely stubborn and set in their ways, craving the knowledge of their opposite Aspect since their own isn't "helping".

## Seer

- Passive -4
- Archetype: Magician
- Gender: Neutral
> One who knows Aspect or knows through Aspect to benefit others

☝️🤓

Seers come from a background that lacks their Aspect, or even one that has great ammounts of their opposite Aspect. This lack of their own or excess of the opposite makes them uncomfortable, which drives them to learn about and pursue their Aspect.

Unlike Mages, Seers learn by observing and studying. They can't experiment with it like Mages do since they lack it around them.

A Seer is good at explaining their knowledge to others, they've studied the theory after all, and use it to guide others. Seers can be too passive at first, and as they grow they start applying their knowledge themselves.

Seers are said to be able to "see" the multiple paths of action they can take. This is what makes them so great at guiding, but seeing all the possibilities can also leave them unable to choose a path and render them frozen or "blinded".

Seers have a behavior usually known as "seersprawl" where they go full nerd mode and infodump. I think it's cute but some might find it annoying, so Seers should learn to be more concise.

Seers can be pretty prideful about their knowledge and ability to learn, which manifests nastily when they're failed and refuse to guide or keep learning, turning pride into feelings of superiority.

A Seer's goal is to be the best guide they can be, and to not be fully passive while not despairing and going fully active.

Their inversion is the [Witch](#witch), where they ignore what they have learned to take matters into their own hands.

## Heir

- Passive -5
- Archetype: Noble/Courtier
- Gender: Masculine
> One who provides Aspect or provides through Aspect to benefit others

(My info on this one is super cryptic? Who wrote this??)

Heirs naturally gravitate towards their Aspect and have great amounts of it.

They also typically have good amounts of their aspect around them, specially in a SBURB session, which makes it easy for them to put situations in their and their allies' favor, often instinctually and sometimes even unconsciously.

At first, Heirs don't have much control of what they provide. They leave traces of their Aspect wherever they go and go so far as to become a symbol of their Aspect, by surrounding themselves with it.

A Heir's goal is to find the balance with their aspect and not let themselves be consumed by it.
