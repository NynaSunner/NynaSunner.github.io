Skaia is orbited by two moons: the close, white caparace inhabited, yellow and light Prospit; and the distant, black caparace inhabited, purple and dark Derse.

Your moon is pretty important in SBURB gameplay, and while it is determined by your personality it's not considered an important part of classpecting like Class and Aspect are. It is, however, needed to determine your True Sign.

## SBURB

The first time the moons become relevant in a session is when a player prototipes a kernelsprite before entering the Medium. The sprite will split and go to each moon's prototyping tower, and give its powers to the queen's ring and the king's scepter.

- If nothing is protptyped before entering the Medium, the session will become a void session, where the Battlefield never reaches its final form so it remains as a eternal stalemate (as two king chess pieces in a 3x3 board). So while this session cannot be lost, it cannot be won either (except with external intervention, as seen with the alpha kids session).

All players have a dream self, an alter ego that awakes when the player is asleep, which is assigned to either Prospit or Derse.

Prospit dreamers are able to see visions of the past, present, and future in Skaia's clouds when Prospit orbits nearby.  
Derse dreamers are able to hear the whispers of the Horrorterrors when Derse orbits close to the Furthest Ring.

Dream selves work as an extra life of sorts, that is triggered by being kissed by another player (postmortem. ew) or by dying in a Quest Bed and going God Tier.

There are two ways of ascending to God Tier. The first one requires for both the real and dream self to be alive, for which the real self needs to die (or be placed shortly after death) in their Quest Bed, causing them to awaken as their dream self and ascend. The second one requires for one of the two selves to be dead, in which the player would need to die in their backup Quest Bed (also called Sacrificial Slab) in the core of their corresponding moon, where they ascend.

Dream selves will get the same wounds as their real self, but with a time delay. That means that when a player is killed and revived as their dream self they have a very limited time before sucumbing to the same wounds and dying. Kissing the dead real self heals the dream self (NEEDS SOURCE).

Players who have lost their dream self will instead dream of the Furthest Ring and the Horrorterrors. This is generally awful for Prospit dreamers as they're not used to them like Derse dreamers are.

## Extended Zodiac

In the Extended Zodiac the moon you belong to is referred to as Lunar Sway. These are the descriptions from the official page:

- Prospit:
> Marked by a flexible optimism, the personalities of Prospit Dreamers are reactive and intuitive. They naturally exist in the present, rather than look to the future or obsess over the past. When making decisions Prospit Dreamers tend to rely on gut instinct and whatever emotions they are experiencing at the moment. This makes them quick to act and reliable in a crisis, but it also can make them capricious. They have trouble thinking things through, and their feelings toward specific situations and decisions can change from day to day. They solve problems with creativity rather than cold logic, often seeing multiple options with ease and clarity. Because they generally take things as they come, Prospit Dreamers are less rebellious than they are adaptable-instead of struggling against authority, they will find a way to coexist with it. Possibly because they are so instinctual and flexible, they like having a defined set of rules-a safety net for their passionate lives. Naturally trusting, they have trouble with deception or hiding their true selves, and will often worry about what others think of them. The self they project into the world is often not under their control.

- Derse:
> Derse Dreamers have personalities marked by a distinct and restless skepticism. Whatever their waking circumstances, chances are they will live in a state of dissatisfaction. Rebellion is in their blood, manifesting whether they are fighting back against a fascist dictatorship, or the most recent trend in casual footwear. Derse Dreamers are cerebral and self-aware; they have a far better grasp on the landscape of their own minds than on the world around them, which they can find alienating and confusing. But as so much of their identity is built on control, they will do their utmost to hide any insecurities, often with false humility or self-deprecating humor. They may be inflexible and pessimistic, but they are also great problem solvers, facing conflicts head-on with shrewd, calculating minds. They see one true path among an infinite snarl of wrong ones. They tend to be introverted, but if you win their trust Derse Dreamers are extremely powerful allies. However, they find sincere vulnerability difficult and will often keep people at arm's length. Letting go and living in the moment is hard for a Derse Dreamer; they constantly look toward the future and analyze the past.

As a TL;DR:
- Prospitians are optimistic, emotional, rash, adaptable, trusting.
- Dersites are skeptic, rebellious, level-headed, pessimistic, introverted.

As a TL;DR of the TL;DR:

When I was taught about classpect I was told that "Prospit dreamers live happily until life slaps them in the face, while Derse dreamers are born already slapped". It sould be noted that the person who told me this was a dersite.

Aspects on <abbr title="Space, Mind, Hope, Breath, Life, and Light">the upper part of the Aspect wheel</abbr> tend to gravitate more towards Prospit, while the ones on <abbr title="Time, Heart, Rage, Blood, Doom, and Void">the the lower part</abbr> tend to gravitate more towards Derse.

The reason why Lunar Sway is considered less important is mostly because it's not part of classpects (since they're just class + aspect), but also because it can be hard to determine which parts are influenced by the Lunar Sway and which are influenced by the classpect. Is a rebellious person a Rage player or are they just a Derse dreamer? Is an optimistic and rash person a Life player or just a Prospit dreamer?

This is also why classpecting comes first, and figuring the Lunar Sway second. The Lunar Sway is considered more like a "flavor" of the given classpect.
