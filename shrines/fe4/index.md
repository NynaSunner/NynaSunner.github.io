    <summary>Changelog</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>8/4/24 - Changed the hand icon to the actual one used in-game and readjusted the positioning to fic it</li>
        <li>5/4/24 - Posted on a hidden page to see how it looks on mobile (IT LOOKS FUCKING GREAT LET'S GOOOO)</li>
        <li>4/4/24 - Added animation and sound on the navbar, using a placeholder img for now</li>
        <li>3/4/24 - Styled the navbar to match the in-game actions menu, making the shadow was AWFUL</li>
        <li>2/4/24 - Styled the main content to match the in-game dialogue boxes, it looks surprisingly nice for a pattern you'd see at your grandma's house</li>
        <li>1/4/24 - Switched font to Pixel Operator and gave it a shadow to simulate a border because the stroke property fills it and since this is a thin font it gets "consumed". Can't make the shadow thicker without it looking like ass tho</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit: I MADE IT THICKER BUT NOW IT'S TOO THICK AND I HATE IT BUT WHOOOO MORE ACCURACY HELL YEAH!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Edit 2: nvm I hated it too much</li>
