# Epic title

This font isn't the FE4 one but to get it I'd have to rip it or remake it and turn it into a .tff which I don't feel like doing, so Pixel Operator it is.

The outline is thin af but I can't make it thicker because it's made with *text-shadow*, and the stroke property fills the text from the inside so since it's thin it just gets "consumed".

Edit: I MADE IT THICKER BUT NOW IT'S TOO THICK AND I HATE IT BUT WHOOOO MORE ACCURACY HELL YEAH!!!!!!!

Edit 2: nvm I hated it too much
