<div markdown="1">
- 16/5/24 - Made the header decent instead of a shitty incest joke. Adjusted line height a bit. Started working on the translations page
    - If only my PC hadn't died and taken with it my exhaustive manga translations list...
- 8/4/24 - Changed the hand icon to the actual one used in-game and readjusted the positioning to fix it
- 5/4/24 - Posted on a hidden page to see how it looks on mobile (IT LOOKS FUCKING GREAT LET'S GOOOO)
- 4/4/24 - Added animation and sound on the navbar, using a placeholder img for now
- 3/4/24 - Styled the navbar to match the in-game actions menu, making the shadow was AWFUL
- 2/4/24 - Styled the main content to match the in-game dialogue boxes, it looks surprisingly nice for a pattern you'd see at your grandma's house
- 1/4/24 - Switched font to Pixel Operator and gave it a shadow to simulate a border because the stroke property fills it and since this is a thin font it gets "consumed". Can't make the shadow thicker without it looking like ass tho
    - Edit: I MADE IT THICKER BUT NOW IT'S TOO THICK AND I HATE IT BUT WHOOOO MORE ACCURACY HELL YEAH!!!!!!!
    - Edit 2: nvm I hated it too much
- 21/3/24 - Added a papyrus texture? Idk what I'm doing
